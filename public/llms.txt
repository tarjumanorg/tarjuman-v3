### Frequently Asked Questions for Saudi Scholarships
Q: Are sworn translations mandatory?
A: Yes. All Indonesian documents must be translated into Arabic by an official Sworn Translator to have legal validity for the Saudi university portals.

Q: Do I need Apostille/Legalization from Kemenlu (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) or Kemenkumham right away?
A: No. For the initial application portal upload stage, only the Sworn Translation is required. Apostille and Embassy legalization are typically only required *after* the student is officially accepted (receives an LoA) to process their student visa.
